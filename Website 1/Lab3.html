					<h2>Who made this website?</h2>
					<p>My name is Salma and this is my first time studying any course related to webapplications. I quiet like it, it's interesting and fun. I wish I would have taken this course earlier.I love to experiment and will try to make more websites in future. I hope I will have more time in future to do so.he height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.</p>

					<h2>Why I am doing this Exercise?</h2>
					<p>I am making this website coz this is part of learning and also assignment for this course. We are learning to make responsive websites for Desktop, Surfpads and for Phones. I love testing animations on websites.
                    Well there's a rose in a fisted glove
                        And the eagle flies with the dove
                        And if you can't be with the one you love.. (personally I'd say you're all SOL!) Great song, smokin" players, great sunday afternoon</p>
